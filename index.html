                <a>Slavic mythology is a polytheistic belief system which originated in the Slavic region of Europe. It is based on the ancient beliefs of the Slavic peoples and has been adapted and modified over the centuries. The pantheon of Slavic gods and goddesses is varied and includes deities such as Perun, Veles, Svarog and Radegast as well as a host of other gods and spirits. Legends and stories from Slavic mythology have been passed down orally from generation to generation and have formed the basis of many modern fairy tales.</a>

They are usually portrayed as being undead, blood-sucking beings who live in the dark and attack unsuspecting victims. Vampires have been featured in many movies, books, television shows and other forms of media over the years.<br>
                    <br>
                    The traditional vampire is typically a pale creature with pointed ears and long sharp fangs. They often wear long flowing capes or cloaks to hide their true nature from human eyes. Vampires feed on human blood in order to survive; though some vampires can also subsist on animal blood.
